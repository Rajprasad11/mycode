					The price to pay is high.<BR><BR>The pressing factors are - not knowing how to say, how to stand, how to address, what to do with your hands, when to speak and when to listen. With numerous eyes fixed on you, it becomes difficult to say what people are thinking and whether you are making the desired impact. There also lies the fact that what may be right for one may not be quite the same for another. 
					<BR>At the end of the day we all want to be effective. We want to make a difference, at the same time be appreciated. Hence, what do you do?
					<BR><BR>The way to play is - 'safe'. Giving people what they want, telling them what they want to hear or how they want to be dealt with, is one way of giving yourself a good start. 
					<BR><BR>This program equips you with the ability to position yourself such that, you have people interested or at least willing to listen. It puts you at ease by placing you at a more professional and polished level when dealing with people.

					Personal Branding is all about you and how you market yourself. It is to do with what people think of you. This can be controlled to a large extent by how you present yourself.

					<BR><BR>You are conveying a Personal Brand in the way you dress, walk, talk, communicate by an email, telephone, in conferences, meetings and most of all in unexpected situations.
					<BR><BR>Your external brand is what people think of you. You could exercise control here; in how you project yourself to the world. It is this projected image that will determine what people think of you and how they choose to communicate with you.
					<BR><BR>If asked, what you think your personal attributes are - you will be surprised at how much they differ from what people may consider to be your attributes. There is a lot of assumption attached to what we think of ourselves. This is where Branding plays it's part. You can choose to make the impression you would like to make instead of the impression people have gathered.
 					<BR><BR>A Personal Brand could be acquired by trial and error or you may choose a systematic approach. The price to pay for messing up is high. Hence, the later serves to be a safer option. You know for a fact you are making the desired impressions. 
					<BR><BR>If you are calling for attention, if people are noticing you and addressing you favorably, it is because you've got it right. 
					<BR><BR>This program will equip you with all that it takes to make the impact you want to make and be perceived as you would like to be. It takes more than the right attire and words. There is a lot that comes into play in the areas of body language, non-verbal communications, behaviour, manner and disposition; not forgetting the timing must be right.
